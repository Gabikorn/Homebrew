Tekeli-li and his surviving kin fled across the tundra with the Reghed tribes in pursuit.",

To keep their leader alive, the other gnolls allowed Tekeli-li to eat them one by one, yet his hunger would not abate. Auril came upon the starving, half-frozen creature and flung Tekeli-li into an icy tomb deep within the glacier. In doing so, the Frostmaiden sought to preserve what the gnoll had becomeâ€”the embodiment of winter's remorseless consumption.",
